# Startup / Important - Notes

These are some of the few bookmarks on various topics ranging from technology, startups, self-help to business.
It may not be properly organized. They say, don't chase perfection, just do it.
Sometimes knowledge doesn't help, so take everything with a grain of salt  :-)

## Distributed Systems Principles
1. Ciruitbreakers, BulkHeading, Rate Limiters, Loadbalancers
2. Fault/latency tolerant
3. Consistent Hashing:
        - Map servers + data to a logical ring
        - Map a request to a range
        - Request is handled by the server responsible for the range (cluster-size can vary dynamically ie, grow/shrink)
4. Message headers
5. Bloom filters (probablistic data structures) [not directly related, but still useful in many places]
6. Http/JSON is typically 20 times slower than gRPC/thrift ie, binary serialization/de-serialization protocols
7. CAP theorem
8. Hard Problems of distributed systems:
     -a. Exactly once delivery
     -b. Guaranteed order of messages
9. Microservices have operational overhead, so require good tooling/automation
10. Microservices are simple inside
11. Microservices are complex from outside/communications perspective
12. Look from these perspectives:
      - Organizational concerns
      - Architectural concerns
      - Developmental concerns
13. Unit testing is easy, integrated testing is hard

## Programming Talks

## Microservices Design Principles
Data Flows :

- 1) Implement as pipelines (serial or parallel)
- 2) Pipeline consists of stateful and statelss services
- 3) Stateful services obtains data
- 4) Statelss services transforms data
- 5) See if you can model a given pipeline/transformation in a single service
     (ie, Pipeline/Orchestration Services, which are again stateless in nature)
- 6) Design systems in sync with reality
- 7) Data moves/flows through the system in a immutable way
- 8) Immutable data flows/pipelines
- 9) CQRS/ Event Sourcing evolution can be handled later in time
- 10) Separation Of concerns based on dataflows

- 11) Data Flow Concerns of the system
    - Lifecycle 
    - Size
    - Structure
    - Velocity
    - Purpose

- Separation of concerns should be applied to both (data + algorithms)
- Results in natural decoupling
- Ex: CQRS, Polyglot persistence, Microservices


- Decouple services (for indepenedent scalaing, evolution, operations)
- Decouple data models
- Define the domain in terms of service interaction, not service implementation
- Design services that have business meaning and clear boundaries
- Check Conway's law, Gattle's system law
  ie, Architecture follows the communication structure of the organization
- The essence of microservices is Collaboration
- Simplify the data model

Design Principles:
- 1. Simplicity
- 2. Decoupling
- 3. Distributed System
- 4. Conways Law
- 5. Gall's system law
